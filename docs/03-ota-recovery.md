# 3. Recovery OTA (Single System)

Recovery OTA updates a single-system device: the new rootfs is staged on the
`userdata` partition and applied by the initramfs on the next reboot. Simple,
disk-efficient — one rootfs partition — but the update window is not
rollback-protected (unlike [A/B OTA](04-ota-ab.md)).

## 1. Build the firmware

```bash
./build.sh recovery -b recomputer-rk3576-devkit
```

Flash the resulting image; the OTA runtime is preinstalled. From now on,
updates are just packages — no reflash.

## 2. Partition layout you are creating

Created by [`recovery/build-hooks/partitions.sh`](../armbian-ota/recovery/build-hooks/partitions.sh), located by GPT labels:

```text
plain:         [ boot ext4 ][ rootfs ext4 ][ userdata ext4 ]
auto-decrypt:  [ boot ext4 ][ security 4M ][ rootfs LUKS+ext4 ][ userdata LUKS+ext4 ]
secure boot:   [ boot raw FIT ][ security 4M ][ rootfs LUKS+ext4 ][ userdata LUKS+ext4 ]
```

| PARTLABEL | fs label | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `boot` | `armbi_boot` | `/boot`, mounted directly (never overlayed) — or raw FIT under secure boot |
| `security` | — | key material (encrypted images only) |
| `rootfs` | `armbi_root` | read-only rootfs lower layer |
| `userdata` | `armbi_usrdata` | overlay upper layer + OTA transaction store; auto-expands on first boot |

Sizes: [`OTA_BOOT_SIZE`](../armbian-ota/common/build-hooks/partitions.sh#L31)
(default 512 MiB), `OTA_ROOTFS_SIZE` (computed +20% headroom),
[`OTA_USERDATA_SIZE`](../armbian-ota/common/build-hooks/partitions.sh#L36)
(default 512 MiB — a build-time floor, expanded to the full disk on first
boot) — see [Build Reference](02-build-reference.md).

### Why updates keep your data

`/` is an overlay mount ([`overlayroot.sh`](../armbian-ota/common/build-hooks/overlayroot.sh),
`recurse=0`):

```text
/       lower: rootfs partition    read-only   replaced wholesale by an update
        upper: userdata partition  writable    apt packages, /home, /var/lib
/boot   direct mount               not overlaid  kernel/armbianEnv.txt visible to U-Boot
```

An update rewrites only the root and boot partitions; the writable upper
layer is never touched, so everything installed or saved survives. On the
first boot [`armbian-resize-userdata`](../armbian-ota/common/rootfs/usr/lib/armbian/armbian-resize-userdata)
grows the userdata partition to fill the disk (encrypted images need one
extra reboot to reopen the LUKS mapping before the filesystem grows).

## 3. Build the update package

Any later build with the same profile **also** emits an OTA package next to
the image:

```text
output/images/<BOARD>/ota/Armbian_*_OTA.tar.gz
```

Stock image names — no `_RECOVERY` suffix; the OTA mode is recorded in
`package.env`.

Contents (assembled by [`package-create.sh`](../armbian-ota/common/build-hooks/package-create.sh)):

| File | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `rootfs.tar.gz` + `rootfs.sha256` | yes | new rootfs |
| `boot.tar.gz` + `boot.sha256` | ext4 boot | new `/boot` contents |
| `boot.itb` | secure boot | signed FIT, written raw — mutually exclusive with `boot.tar.gz` |
| `package.env` | yes | `OTA_MODE`, `OTA_ENCRYPTED`, board/release/branch/version/kernel metadata |
| `version.txt` | yes | image name, build commit, extension commit |
| `rootfs.tar.gz.enc`, `payload.manifest`, `payload.manifest.sig` | encrypted images | see [below](#6-encrypted-images) |

Next to the package the build also writes `<image>_OTA.checksums`
(MD5 + SHA256 of the tarball) for distribution-side integrity checks.

Transfer the package to the device any way you like (scp, USB, download).

## 4. Apply an update on the device

**On device:**

```bash
armbian-ota start /path/to/Armbian_..._OTA.tar.gz
reboot
```

`armbian-ota start` ([source](../armbian-ota/common/rootfs/usr/sbin/armbian-ota)):

- takes exactly one argument — no options; the mode is auto-detected from
  `package.env` and must match the firmware (`OTA_MODE=recovery`),
- refuses a package whose encryption state differs from the device
  (`OTA_ENCRYPTED` vs. actual),
- verifies checksums (and, on encrypted images, the manifest signature —
  secure-boot builds only, an unsigned manifest is accepted with a
  warning; see [06-secure-boot.md](06-secure-boot.md)),
- stages everything under `userdata/ota-recovery/ota_work/` and marks the
  state `prepared`.

Then reboot. The initramfs does the rest — see next section.

After the update reboot:

```bash
armbian-ota status     # STATUS=success
```

## 5. What happens during the update reboot

The initramfs hook
([`scripts/init-premount/99-ota-apply`](../armbian-ota/recovery/initramfs/scripts/init-premount/99-ota-apply))
runs before the real root is mounted. It anchors every device lookup to
the disk U-Boot actually booted from (`armbian.bootdev` cmdline tokens —
a cloned disk can never capture the update), validates the staged
payload, then applies the new rootfs and boot contents in one verified
pass, patches `armbianEnv.txt`/fstab/crypttab for the new UUIDs, removes
the staging area, marks `STATUS=success`, and reboots.

**Failure behavior:** any error makes the hook exit 0 and boot the old
system; the staged payload is retried on every subsequent boot until it
succeeds. There is no retry counter and no automatic fallback to a
previous rootfs — if you need that, use [A/B OTA](04-ota-ab.md).

[`armbian-ota/README.md`](../armbian-ota/README.md#how-ota-works).

## 6. Encrypted images

On encrypted builds the update flow is identical from the user's perspective,
but:

- the package carries `rootfs.tar.gz.enc` instead of plaintext; the device
  verifies `payload.manifest.sig` (RSA-PSS, when present) before
  decrypting, then re-checks digests — key derivation and verification in
  [`common.sh`](../armbian-ota/common/rootfs/usr/share/armbian-ota/common.sh);
- the initramfs applies the payload through `/dev/mapper/armbian-root`;
- the same passphrase/keys unlock everything — see
  [05-encryption.md](05-encryption.md).

## 7. Troubleshooting

**On device:**

```bash
armbian-ota status                    # state machine position
cat /var/log/armbian-ota/ota.log      # start-time verification/staging log
cat /run/initramfs/ota.log            # initramfs apply log (after reboot)
ls /dev/disk/by-partlabel/            # verify partitions are on the boot disk
```

| Symptom | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `OTA package encryption mismatch` | Package tier ≠ device tier — flash matching firmware or rebuild the package |
| `STATUS=prepared` persists after reboot | Initramfs apply keeps failing — read `/run/initramfs/ota.log` |
| Partition not found | It must live on the U-Boot boot disk (multi-disk anchoring) |
