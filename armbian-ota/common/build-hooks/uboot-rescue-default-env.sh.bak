# Stage the Seeed rescue-default-env U-Boot patch (recovery OTA v0.8 design
# section 3.4) into the userpatches overlay for EVERY build flavor.
#
# The patch's default bootcmd is self-routing: ota_rescue_boot boots the
# /recovery/ assets only when they exist and falls through to
# distro_bootcmd otherwise, so the same compiled U-Boot is correct for
# recovery-OTA, plain and A/B images. Staging unconditionally keeps:
#   - one stable U-Boot artifact hash across flavors sharing a checkout
#     (patches_hash covers this location; a gated patch used to bump the
#     artifact version and thrash the cache whenever flavors alternated);
#   - no stale-patch risk window (the previous stage/sweep pair had to run
#     on every single build or a recovery build's patch leaked into the
#     next plain build's U-Boot).
#
# Staging targets USERPATCHES_PATH (not SRC/patch) so the framework tree
# stays untouched. The patch versions together with the rest of the v0.8
# pieces under this repository's release tags.
